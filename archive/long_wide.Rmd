## Long & Wide Data Formats

Often, you'll need to convert a dataframe from wide to long format.  And sometimes, you may need to go the other way.  To illustrate, the file home_ownership.txt contains "homeownership rates, in percentages, by state for the years 1985, 1996, and 2002. These values represent the proportion of homes owned by the occupant to the total number of occupied homes" (Ott & Longnecker, 2016, p. 129).  The file used in the code below contains just 11 rows of the complete dataset.  

```{r wide_long_1}
library(reshape2)  # Load the reshape2 library.

# Read in the file -- values are separated by tabs -- do not convert to factors.

home_own_wide <- read.delim("home_ownership.txt", sep = "\t", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

home_own_wide      # Take a look at the data in wide format.

home_own_long <- melt(home_own_wide, id = "state")

home_own_long      # Now take a look at the data in long format.

```

As you can see, the year columns in the wide format are stacked when converted to the long format.  Many of R's statistical functions will return errors if the data is presented to them in wide format. \newline

## Challenge 1  

Now that you've had a chance to see how to convert a dataframe from wide to long format, let's practice doing this with the data in wide.csv.  Because the data in this file is in a wide format, you'll need to write code to convert it to a long format.  And then, as a test of your knowledge, convert the file back to wide.  

```{r wide_long_2}

# A small dataset to convert to long format and then back again.

wide <- read.csv("wide.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
wide

long <- melt(wide, id.vars = c("person", "age", "gender"))
long

wide <- dcast(long, person ~ variable)
wide

```

## Challenge 2

In this challenge, you'll convert a dataset from long to wide format.  The bdstat dataset is part of the MESS package.  It contains Danish births and deaths per month and year, from 1901 to 2013.  The data is in long format and in this challenge you'll need to convert it to wide.  First, load the MESS package and the dataset and then write code to convert it.  

```{r}

library(MESS)

# This dataset contains Danish births and deaths by year and month.  It is
# in long format, and we want to convert it to a wide format.

data("bdstat")

head(bdstat)

wide <- dcast(bdstat, year ~ month, value.var = "births")

head(wide)

```
