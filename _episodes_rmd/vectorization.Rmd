Most of R's functions are vectorized, meaning that the function will
operate on all elements of a vector without needing to loop through
and act on each element one at a time. This makes writing code more
concise, easy to read, and less error prone.


```{r}
x <- 1:4
x * 2
```

The multiplication happened to each element of the vector.

We can also add two vectors together:

```{r}
y <- 6:9
x + y
```

Each element of `x` was added to its corresponding element of `y`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
x:  1  2  3  4
    +  +  +  +
y:  6  7  8  9
---------------
    7  9 11 13
```


### Challenge 1

Let's try this on the `pop` column of the `gapminder` dataset.

Make a new column in the `gapminder` data frame that contains population in units of millions of people. Check the head or tail of the data frame to make sure it worked.

<div class="fold s">

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Solution to Challenge 1
# Let's try this on the `pop` column of the `gapminder` dataset.

# Make a new column in the `gapminder` data frame that
# contains population in units of millions of people.
# Check the head or tail of the data frame to make sure
# it worked.

gapminder$pop_millions <- gapminder$pop / 1e6
head(gapminder)

```

</div>


### Challenge 2

On a single graph, plot population, in
millions, against year, for all countries. Don't worry about
identifying which country is which.

Repeat the exercise, graphing only for China, India, and
Indonesia. Again, don't worry about which is which.

<div class="fold s">

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Solution to Challenge 2
# Refresh your plotting skills by plotting population in millions against year.

ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = year, y = pop_millions)) +
       geom_point()

countryset <- c("China","India","Indonesia")

ggplot(gapminder[gapminder$country %in% countryset,],
       aes(x = year, y = pop_millions)) +
       geom_point()

```

</div>


Comparison operators, logical operators, and many functions are also
vectorized:


**Comparison operators**

```{r}
x > 2
```

**Logical operators**
```{r}
a <- x > 3  # or, for clarity, a <- (x > 3)
a
```

> ### Tip: some useful functions for logical vectors
>
> `any()` will return `TRUE` if *any* element of a vector is `TRUE`
> `all()` will return `TRUE` if *all* elements of a vector are `TRUE`

Most functions also operate element-wise on vectors:

**Functions**
```{r}
x <- 1:4
log(x)
```

### Challenge 4

We're interested in looking at the sum of the
following sequence of fractions:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
  x = 1/(1^2) + 1/(2^2) + 1/(3^2) + ... + 1/(n^2)
```

This would be tedious to type out, and impossible for high values of
n.  Use vectorisation to compute x when n=100. What is the sum when
n=10,000?

<div class="fold s">

```{r eval = FALSE}

sum(1/(1:100)^2)
sum(1/(1:1e04)^2)
n <- 10000
sum(1/(1:n)^2)

# We can also obtain the same results using a function:

inverse_sum_of_squares <- function(n) {
   sum(1/(1:n)^2)
}

inverse_sum_of_squares(100)
inverse_sum_of_squares(10000)

n <- 10000
inverse_sum_of_squares(n)

```

</div>
